      "brick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground\n",
      "plan was wild.</s> <s>It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,\n",
      "faintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes\n",
      "Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\n",
      "impression that the two sovereigns were identical.</s> <s>It was described\n",
      "with some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any\n",
      "definable way produced any art.</s> <s>But although its pretensions to be\n",
      "an intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a\n",
      "pleasant place were quite indisputable.</s> <s>The stranger who looked for\n",
      "the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very\n",
      "oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them.</s> <s>Nor when\n",
      "he met the people was he disappointed in this respect.</s> <s>The place\n",
      "was not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not\n",
      "as a deception but rather as a dream.</s> <s>Even if the people were not\n",
      "'artists,' the whole was nevertheless artistic.</s> <s>That young man with\n",
      "the long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not\n",
      "really a poet; but surely he was a poem.</s> <s>That old gentleman with\n",
      "the wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable\n",
      "humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\n",
      "of philosophy in others.</s> <s>That scientific gentleman with the bald,\n",
      "egg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the\n",
      "airs of science that he assumed.</s> <s>He had not discovered anything new\n",
      "in biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered\n",
      "more singular than himself?</s> <s>Thus, and thus only, the whole place\n",
      "had properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much\n",
      "as a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.</s>\n",
      "<s>A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\n",
      "stepped into a written comedy.</s>\n",

      "didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to\n",
      "women.</s> <s>The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the\n",
      "paradoxes of the place.</s> <s>Most of the women were of the kind vaguely\n",
      "called emancipated, and professed some protest against male\n",
      "supremacy.</s> <s>Yet these new women would always pay to a man the\n",
      "extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,\n",
      "that of listening while he is talking.</s> <s>And Mr.</s> <s>Lucian Gregory, the\n",
      "red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\n",
      "to, even if one only laughed at the end of it.</s> <s>He put the old cant\n",
      "of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain\n",
      "impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure.</s> <s>He was\n",
      "helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,\n",

      "of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended.</s> <s>The new poet, who\n",
      "introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very\n",
      "mild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow\n",

      "<s>He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,\n",
