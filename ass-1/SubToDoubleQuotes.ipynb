       "\"[The Man Who Was Thursday by G. K. Chesterton 1908]\\n\\nTo Edmund Clerihew Bentley\\n\\nA cloud was on the mind of men, and wailing went the weather,\\nYea, a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together.\\nScience announced nonentity and art admired decay;\\nThe world was old and ended: but you and I were gay;\\nRound us in antic order their crippled vices came--\\nLust that had lost its laughter, fear that had lost its shame.\\nLike the white lock of Whistler, that lit our aimless gloom,\\nMen showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume.\\nLife was a fly that faded, and death a drone that stung;\\nThe world was very old indeed when you and I were young.\\nThey twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named:\\nMen were ashamed of honour; but we were not ashamed.\\nWeak if we were and foolish, not thus we failed, not thus;\\nWhen that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us\\nChildren we were--our forts of sand were even as weak as eve,\\nHigh as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea.\\nFools as we were in motley, all jangling and absurd,\\nWhen all church bells were silent our cap and beds were heard.\\n\\nNot all unhelped we held the fort, our tiny flags unfurled;\\nSome giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world.\\nI find again the book we found, I feel the hour that flings\\nFar out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things;\\nAnd the Green Carnation withered, as in forest fires that pass,\\nRoared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass;\\nOr sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain--\\nTruth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain.\\nYea, cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey,\\nDunedin to Samoa spoke, and darkness unto day.\\nBut we were young; we lived to see God break their bitter charms.\\nGod and the good Republic come riding back in arms:\\nWe have seen the City of Mansoul, even as it rocked, relieved--\\nBlessed are they who did not see, but being blind, believed.\\n\\nThis is a tale of those old fears, even of those emptied hells,\\nAnd none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells--\\nOf what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash,\\nOf what huge devils hid the stars, yet fell at a pistol flash.\\nThe doubts that were so plain to chase, so dreadful to withstand--\\nOh, who shall understand but you; yea, who shall understand?\\nThe doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain,\\nAnd day had broken on the streets e'er it broke upon the brain.\\nBetween us, by the peace of God, such truth can now be told;\\nYea, there is strength in striking root and good in growing old.\\nWe have found common things at last and marriage and a creed,\\nAnd I may safely write it now, and you may safely read.\\n\\nG. K. C.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK\\n\\nTHE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as\\nred and ragged as a cloud of sunset. It was built of a bright\\nbrick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground\\nplan was wild. It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,\\nfaintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes\\nElizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\\nimpression that the two sovereigns were identical. It was described\\nwith some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any\\ndefinable way produced any art. But although its pretensions to be\\nan intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a\\npleasant place were quite indisputable. The stranger who looked for\\nthe first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very\\noddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them. Nor when\\nhe met the people was he disappointed in this respect. The place\\nwas not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not\\nas a deception but rather as a dream. Even if the people were not\\n'artists,' the whole was nevertheless artistic. That young man with\\nthe long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not\\nreally a poet; but surely he was a poem. That old gentleman with\\nthe wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable\\nhumbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\\nof philosophy in others. That scientific gentleman with the bald,\\negg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the\\nairs of science that he assumed. He had not discovered anything new\\nin biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered\\nmore singular than himself? Thus, and thus only, the whole place\\nhad properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much\\nas a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.\\nA man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\\nstepped into a written comedy.\\n\\nMore especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about\\nnightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the\\nafterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a\\ndrifting cloud. This again was more strongly true of the many\\nnights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often\\nilluminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish\\ntrees like some fierce and monstrous fruit. And this was strongest\\nof all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the\\nlocality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero. It was not\\nby any means the only evening of which he was the hero. On many\\nnights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high,\\ndidactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to\\nwomen. The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the\\nparadoxes of the place. Most of the women were of the kind vaguely\\ncalled emancipated, and professed some protest against male\\nsupremacy. Yet these new women would always pay to a man the\\nextravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,\\nthat of listening while he is talking. And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the\\nred-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\\nto, even if one only laughed at the end of it. He put the old cant\\nof the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain\\nimpudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure. He was\\nhelped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,\\nwhich he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth. His dark\\nred hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman's, and\\ncurved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.\\nFrom within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected\\nsuddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of\\ncockney contempt. This combination at once tickled and terrified\\nthe nerves of a neurotic population. He seemed like a walking\\nblasphemy, a blend of the angel and the ape.\\n\\nThis particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else,\\nwill be remembered in that place for its strange sunset. It looked\\nlike the end of the world. All the heaven seemed covered with a\\nquite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky\\nwas full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the\\nface. Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the\\nstrangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale\\ngreen; but towards the west the whole grew past description,\\ntransparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it\\ncovered up the sun like something too good to be seen. The whole\\nwas so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent\\nsecrecy. The very empyrean seemed to be a secret. It expressed\\nthat splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism. The\\nvery sky seemed small.\\n\\nI say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening\\nif only by that oppressive sky. There are others who may remember\\nit because it marked the first appearance in the place of the\\nsecond poet of Saffron Park. For a long time the red-haired\\nrevolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was upon the night\\nof the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended. The new poet, who\\nintroduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very\\nmild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow\\nhair. But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked.\\nHe signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,\\nGregory, upon the whole nature of poetry. He said that he (Syme)\\nwas poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet of\\nrespectability. So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he\\nhad that moment fallen out of that impossible sky.\\n\\nIn fact, Mr. Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the two\\nevents.\\n\\n'It may well be,' he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, 'it may\\nwell be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is\\nbrought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet.\\nYou say you are a poet of law; I say you are a contradiction in\\nterms. I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the\\nnight you appeared in this garden.'\\n\\nThe man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured\\nthese thunders with a certain submissive solemnity. The third party\\nof the group, Gregory's sister Rosamond, who had her brother's\\nbraids of red hair, but a kindlier face underneath them, laughed\\nwith such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave\\ncommonly to the family oracle.\\n\\nGregory resumed in high oratorical good humour.\\n\\n'An artist is identical with an anarchist,' he cried. 'You might\\ntranspose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man\\nwho throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment\\nto everything. He sees how much more valuable is one burst of\\nblazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the mere common\\nbodies of a few shapeless policemen. An artist disregards all\\ngovernments, abolishes all conventions. The poet delights in\\ndisorder only. If it were not so, the most poetical thing in the\\nworld would be the Underground Railway.'\\n\\n'So it is,' said Mr. Syme.\\n\\n'Nonsense!' said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else\\nattempted paradox. 'Why do all the clerks and navvies in the\\nrailway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will\\ntell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It\\nis because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket\\nfor that place they will reach. It is because after they have\\npassed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be\\nVictoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh,\\ntheir eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next\\nstation were unaccountably Baker Street!'\\n\\n'It is you who are unpoetical,' replied the poet Syme. 'If what you\\nsay of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry.\\nThe rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious\\nthing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild\\narrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with\\none wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because\\nin chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to\\nBagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that\\nhe does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books\\nof mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of\\npride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give\\nme Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I\\nsay!'\\n\\n'Must you go?' inquired Gregory sarcastically.\\n\\n'I tell you,' went on Syme with passion, 'that every time a train\\ncomes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and\\nthat man has won a battle against chaos. You say contemptuously\\nthat when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria. I\\nsay that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever\\nI really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And\\nwhen I hear the guard shout out the word 'Victoria,' it is not an\\nunmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing\\nconquest. It is to me indeed 'Victoria'; it is the victory of\\nAdam.'\\n\\nGregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sad smile.\\n\\n'And even then,' he said, 'we poets always ask the question, 'And\\nwhat is Victoria now that you have got there ?' You think Victoria\\nis like the New Jerusalem. We know that the New Jerusalem will only\\nbe like Victoria. Yes, the poet will be discontented even in the\\nstreets of heaven. The poet is always in revolt.'\\n\\n'There again,' said Syme irritably, 'what is there poetical about\\nbeing in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be\\nsea-sick. Being sick is a revolt. Both being sick and being\\nrebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate\\noccasions; but I'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical.\\nRevolt in the abstract is--revolting. It's mere vomiting.'\\n\\nThe girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but Syme was\\ntoo hot to heed her.\\n\\n'It is things going right,' he cried, 'that is poetical I Our\\ndigestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right, that\\nis the foundation of all poetry. Yes, the most poetical thing, more\\npoetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars--the most\\npoetical thing in the world is not being sick.'\\n\\n'Really,' said Gregory superciliously, 'the examples you choose--'\\n\\n'I beg your pardon,' said Syme grimly, 'I forgot we had abolished\\nall conventions.'\\n\\nFor the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory's forehead.\\n\\n'You don't expect me,' he said, 'to revolutionise society on this\\nlawn ?'\\n\\nSyme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly.\\n\\n'No, I don't,' he said; 'but I suppose that if you were serious\\nabout your anarchism, that is exactly what you would do.'\\n\\nGregory's big bull's eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry\\nlion, and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose.\\n\\n'Don't you think, then,' he said in a dangerous voice, 'that I am\\nserious about my anarchism?'\\n\\n'I beg your pardon ?' said Syme.\\n\\n'Am I not serious about my anarchism ?' cried Gregory, with knotted\\nfists.\\n\\n'My dear fellow!' said Syme, and strolled away.\\n\\nWith surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond\\nGregory still in his company.\\n\\n'Mr. Syme,' she said, 'do the people who talk like you and my\\nbrother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?'\\n\\nSyme smiled.\\n\\n'Do you ?' he asked.\\n\\n'What do you mean ?' asked the girl, with grave eyes.\\n\\n'My dear Miss Gregory,' said Syme gently, 'there are many kinds of\\nsincerity and insincerity. When you say 'thank you' for the salt,\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. When you say 'the world is round,'\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. It is true, but you don't mean it.\\nNow, sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does\\nmean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but\\nthen he says more than he means--from sheer force of meaning it.'\\n\\nShe was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave\\nand open, and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that\\nunreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most\\nfrivolous woman, the maternal watch which is as old as the world.\\n\\n'Is he really an anarchist, then?' she asked.\\n\\n'Only in that sense I speak of,' replied Syme; 'or if you prefer\\nit, in that nonsense.'\\n\\nShe drew her broad brows together and said abruptly--\\n\\n'He wouldn't really use--bombs or that sort of thing?'\\n\\nSyme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight\\nand somewhat dandified figure.\\n\\n'Good Lord, no!' he said, 'that has to be done anonymously.'\\n\\nAnd at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and\\nshe thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory's absurdity\\nand of his safety.\\n\\nSyme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and\\ncontinued to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and\\nin spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.\\nAnd it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man\\nwatches himself too closely. He defended respectability with\\nviolence and exaggeration. He grew passionate in his praise of\\ntidiness and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac\\nall round him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a\\nbarrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic\\nwords were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world.\\n\\nHe stared and talked at the girl's red hair and amused face for\\nwhat seemed to be a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups\\nin such a place should mix, rose to his feet. To his astonishment,\\nhe discovered the whole garden empty. Everyone had gone long ago,\\nand he went himself with a rather hurried apology. He left with a\\nsense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwards\\nexplain. In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no\\npart at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over.\\nAnd yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a\\nmotive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the\\nglory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark\\nand ill-drawn tapestries of the night. For what followed was so\\nimprobable, that it might well have been a dream.\\n\\nWhen Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the\\nmoment empty. Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silence\\nwas rather a living silence than a dead one. Directly outside the\\ndoor stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree\\nthat bent out over the fence behind him. About a foot from the\\nlamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the\\nlamp-post itself. The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the\\nface, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark. Only a fringe of\\nfiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the\\nattitude, proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory. He had something\\nof the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe.\\n\\nHe made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more\\nformally returned.\\n\\n'I was waiting for you,' said Gregory. 'Might I have a moment's\\nconversation?'\\n\\n'Certainly. About what?' asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder.\\n\\nGregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at the\\ntree. 'About this and this,' he cried; 'about order and anarchy.\\nThere is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and\\nbarren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing\\nitself--there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.'\\n\\n'All the same,' replied Syme patiently, 'just at present you only\\nsee the tree by the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever\\nsee the lamp by the light of the tree.' Then after a pause he said,\\n'But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only\\nto resume our little argument?'\\n\\n'No,' cried out Gregory, in a voice that rang down the street, 'I\\ndid not stand here to resume our argument, but to end it for ever.'\\n\\nThe silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing,\\nlistened instinctively for something serious. Gregory began in a\\nsmooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile.\\n\\n'Mr. Syme,' he said, 'this evening you succeeded in doing something\\nrather remarkable. You did something to me that no man born of\\nwoman has ever succeeded in doing before.'\\n\\n'Indeed!'\\n\\n'Now I remember,' resumed Gregory reflectively, 'one other person\\nsucceeded in doing it. The captain of a penny steamer (if I\\nremember correctly) at Southend. You have irritated me.'\\n\\n'I am very sorry,' replied Syme with gravity.\\n\\n'I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped\\nout even with an apology,' said Gregory very calmly. 'No duel\\ncould wipe it out. If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out.\\nThere is only one way by which that insult can be erased, and that\\nway I choose. I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and\\nhonour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said.'\\n\\n'In what I said?'\\n\\n'You said I was not serious about being an anarchist.'\\n\\n'There are degrees of seriousness,' replied Syme. 'I have never\\ndoubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you\\nthought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a\\nparadox might wake men up to a neglected truth.'\\n\\nGregory stared at him steadily and painfully.\\n\\n'And in no other sense,' he asked, 'you think me serious? You think\\nme a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths. You do not think that\\nin a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious.'\\n\\nSyme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road.\\n\\n'Serious!' he cried. 'Good Lord! is this street serious? Are these\\ndamned Chinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious?\\nOne comes here and talks a pack of bosh, and perhaps some sense as\\nwell, but I should think very little of a man who didn't keep\\nsomething in the background of his life that was more serious than\\nall this talking--something more serious, whether it was religion\\nor only drink.'\\n\\n'Very well,' said Gregory, his face darkening, 'you shall see\\nsomething more serious than either drink or religion.'\\n\\nSyme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory\\nagain opened his lips.\\n\\n'You spoke just now of having a religion. Is it really true that\\nyou have one?'\\n\\n'Oh,' said Syme with a beaming smile, 'we are all Catholics now.'\\n\\n'Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your\\nreligion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to\\ntell you to any son of Adam, and especially not to the police?\\nWill you swear that! If you will take upon yourself this awful\\nabnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow\\nthat you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream\\nabout, I will promise you in return--'\\n\\n'You will promise me in return?' inquired Syme, as the other\\npaused.\\n\\n'I will promise you a very entertaining evening.' Syme suddenly\\ntook off his hat.\\n\\n'Your offer,' he said, 'is far too idiotic to be declined. You say\\nthat a poet is always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least\\nthat he is always a sportsman. Permit me, here and now, to swear as\\na Christian, and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist,\\nthat I will not report anything of this, whatever it is, to the\\npolice. And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is it?'\\n\\n'I think,' said Gregory, with placid irrelevancy, 'that we will\\ncall a cab.'\\n\\nHe gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down the\\nroad. The two got into it in silence. Gregory gave through the\\ntrap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank\\nof the river. The cab whisked itself away again, and in it these\\ntwo fantastics quitted their fantastic town.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME\\n\\nTHE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop,\\ninto which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion. They seated\\nthemselves in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour, at a stained\\nwooden table with one wooden leg. The room was so small and dark,\\nthat very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned,\\nbeyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded.\\n\\n'Will you take a little supper?' asked Gregory politely. 'The pate\\nde foie gras is not good here, but I can recommend the game.'\\n\\nSyme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be a joke.\\nAccepting the vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred\\nindifference--\\n\\n'Oh, bring me some lobster mayonnaise.'\\n\\nTo his indescribable astonishment, the man only said 'Certainly,\\nsir!' and went away apparently to get it.\\n\\n'What will you drink?' resumed Gregory, with the same careless yet\\napologetic air. 'I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself; I have\\ndined. But the champagne can really be trusted. Do let me start you\\nwith a half-bottle of Pommery at least?'\\n\\n'Thank you!' said the motionless Syme. 'You are very good.'\\n\\nHis further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in\\nthemselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the\\nactual appearance of the lobster. Syme tasted it, and found it\\nparticularly good. Then he suddenly began to eat with great\\nrapidity and appetite.\\n\\n'Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!' he said to Gregory,\\nsmiling. 'I don't often have the luck to have a dream like this. It\\nis new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster. It is commonly\\nthe other way.'\\n\\n'You are not asleep, I assure you,' said Gregory. 'You are, on the\\ncontrary, close to the most actual and rousing moment of your\\nexistence. Ah, here comes your champagne! I admit that there may be\\na slight disproportion, let us say, between the inner arrangements\\nof this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior.\\nBut that is all our modesty. We are the most modest men that ever\\nlived on earth.'\\n\\n'And who are we?' asked Syme, emptying his champagne glass.\\n\\n'It is quite simple,' replied Gregory. 'We are the serious\\nanarchists, in whom you do not believe.'\\n\\n'Oh!' said Syme shortly. 'You do yourselves well in drinks.'\\n\\n'Yes, we are serious about everything,' answered Gregory.\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n'If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little,\\ndon't put it down to your inroads into the champagne. I don't wish\\nyou to do yourself an injustice.'\\n\\n'Well, if I am not drunk, I am mad,' replied Syme with perfect\\ncalm; 'but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either\\ncondition. May I smoke?'\\n\\n'Certainly!' said Gregory, producing a cigar-case. 'Try one of\\nmine.'\\n\\nSyme took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out\\nof his waistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and\\nlet out a long cloud of smoke. It is not a little to his credit\\nthat he performed these rites with so much composure, for almost\\nbefore he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to\\nrevolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insane\\nseance.\\n\\n'You must not mind it,' said Gregory; 'it's a kind of screw.'\\n\\n'Quite so,' said Syme placidly, 'a kind of screw. How simple that\\nis!'\\n\\nThe next moment the smoke of his cigar, which had been wavering\\nacross the room in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a\\nfactory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot\\ndown through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them. They\\nwent rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift\\ncut loose, and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom. But\\nwhen Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red\\nsubterranean light, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown\\nover the other, and had not turned a yellow hair.\\n\\nGregory led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which\\nwas the red light. It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as\\nbig as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door. In the\\ndoor there was a sort of hatchway or grating, and on this Gregory\\nstruck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him\\nwho he was. To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply,\\n'Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.' The heavy hinges began to move; it was\\nobviously some kind of password.\\n\\nInside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a\\nnetwork of steel. On a second glance, Syme saw that the glittering\\npattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and\\nrevolvers, closely packed or interlocked.\\n\\n'I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities,' said Gregory;\\n'we have to be very strict here.'\\n\\n'Oh, don't apologise,' said Syme. 'I know your passion for law and\\norder,' and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel\\nweapons. With his long, fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat, he\\nlooked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down\\nthat shining avenue of death.\\n\\nThey passed through several such passages, and came out at last\\ninto a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in\\nshape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, something of the\\nappearance of a scientific lecture-theatre. There were no rifles or\\npistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more\\ndubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the bulbs of\\niron plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and the\\nvery room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb. Syme knocked his\\ncigar ash off against the wall, and went in.\\n\\n'And now, my dear Mr. Syme,' said Gregory, throwing himself in an\\nexpansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb, 'now we are\\nquite cosy, so let us talk properly. Now no human words can give\\nyou any notion of why I brought you here. It was one of those quite\\narbitrary emotions, like jumping off a cliff or falling in love.\\nSuffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow,\\nand, to do you justice, you are still. I would break twenty oaths\\nof secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg. That way you\\nhave of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of\\nconfession. Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a\\nserious anarchist. Does this place strike you as being serious?'\\n\\n'It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety,' assented\\nSyme; 'but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give\\nme information, because, as you remember, you very wisely extorted\\nfrom me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall\\ncertainly keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries.\\nFirst of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object\\nto? You want to abolish Government?'\\n\\n'To abolish God!' said Gregory, opening the eyes of a fanatic. 'We\\ndo not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations;\\nthat sort of anarchism does exist, but it is a mere branch of the\\nNonconformists. We dig deeper and we blow you higher. We wish to\\ndeny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour\\nand treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly\\nsentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of\\nMan! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and\\nWrong.'\\n\\n'And Right and Left,' said Syme with a simple eagerness, 'I hope\\nyou will abolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me.'\\n\\n'You spoke of a second question,' snapped Gregory.\\n\\n'With pleasure,' resumed Syme. 'In all your present acts and\\nsurroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an\\naunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have\\nfound people living from preference under a public-house. You have\\na heavy iron door. You cannot pass it without submitting to the\\nhumiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain. You surround\\nyourself with steel instruments which make the place, if I may say\\nso, more impressive than homelike. May I ask why, after taking all\\nthis trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth,\\nyou then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to\\nevery silly woman in Saffron Park?'\\n\\nGregory smiled.\\n\\n'The answer is simple,' he said. 'I told you I was a serious\\nanarchist, and you did not believe me. Nor do they believe me.\\nUnless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe\\nme.'\\n\\nSyme smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him with interest. Gregory\\nwent on.\\n\\n'The history of the thing might amuse you,' he said. 'When first I\\nbecame one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable\\ndisguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops\\nin our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and\\nPriests of Prey. I certainly understood from them that bishops are\\nstrange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind.\\nI was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters\\nin a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, 'Down! down!\\npresumptuous human reason!' they found out in some way that I was\\nnot a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once. Then I made up as a\\nmillionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that\\na fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I tried being a\\nmajor. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough\\nintellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like\\nNietzsche, admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all\\nthat, you know. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and\\nwaved it constantly. I called out 'Blood!' abstractedly, like a\\nman calling for wine. I often said, 'Let the weak perish; it is\\nthe Law.' Well, well, it seems majors don't do this. I was nabbed\\nagain. At last I went in despair to the President of the Central\\nAnarchist Council, who is the greatest man in Europe.'\\n\\n'What is his name?' asked Syme.\\n\\n'You would not know it,' answered Gregory. 'That is his greatness.\\nCaesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of, and\\nthey were heard of. He puts all his genius into not being heard of,\\nand he is not heard of. But you cannot be for five minutes in the\\nroom with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have\\nbeen children in his hands.'\\n\\nHe was silent and even pale for a moment, and then resumed--\\n\\n'But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling\\nas an epigram, and yet as practical as the Bank of England. I said\\nto him, 'What disguise will hide me from the world? What can I find\\nmore respectable than bishops and majors?' He looked at me with his\\nlarge but indecipherable face. 'You want a safe disguise, do you?\\nYou want a dress which will guarantee you harmless; a dress in\\nwhich no one would ever look for a bomb?' I nodded. He suddenly\\nlifted his lion's voice. 'Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you\\nfool!' he roared so that the room shook. 'Nobody will ever expect\\nyou to do anything dangerous then.' And he turned his broad back\\non me without another word. I took his advice, and have never\\nregretted it. I preached blood and murder to those women day and\\nnight, and--by God!--they would let me wheel their perambulators.'\\n\\nSyme sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes.\\n\\n'You took me in,' he said. 'It is really a smart dodge.'\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n'What do you call this tremendous President of yours?'\\n\\n'We generally call him Sunday,' replied Gregory with simplicity.\\n'You see, there are seven members of the Central Anarchist\\nCouncil, and they are named after days of the week. He is called\\nSunday, by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday. It is curious you\\nshould mention the matter, because the very night you have dropped\\nin (if I may so express it) is the night on which our London\\nbranch, which assembles in this room, has to elect its own deputy\\nto fill a vacancy in the Council. The gentleman who has for some\\ntime past played, with propriety and general applause, the\\ndifficult part of Thursday, has died quite suddenly. Consequently,\\nwe have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor.'\\n\\nHe got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of\\nsmiling embarrassment.\\n\\n'I feel somehow as if you were my mother, Syme,' he continued\\ncasually. 'I feel that I can confide anything to you, as you have\\npromised to tell nobody. In fact, I will confide to you something\\nthat I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be\\ncoming to the room in about ten minutes. We shall, of course, go\\nthrough a form of election; but I don't mind telling you that it is\\npractically certain what the result will be.' He looked down for a\\nmoment modestly. 'It is almost a settled thing that I am to be\\nThursday.'\\n\\n'My dear fellow.' said Syme heartily, 'I congratulate you. A great\\ncareer!'\\n\\nGregory smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talking\\nrapidly.\\n\\n'As a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table,' he\\nsaid, 'and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible.'\\n\\nSyme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a\\nwalking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick,\\na large Colt's revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of\\nbrandy. Over the chair, beside the table, was thrown a\\nheavy-looking cape or cloak.\\n\\n'I have only to get the form of election finished,' continued\\nGregory with animation, 'then I snatch up this cloak and stick,\\nstuff these other things into my pocket, step out of a door in\\nthis cavern, which opens on the river, where there is a steam-tug\\nalready waiting for me, and then--then--oh, the wild joy of being\\nThursday!' And he clasped his hands.\\n\\nSyme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor,\\ngot to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation.\\n\\n'Why is it,' he asked vaguely, 'that I think you are quite a decent\\nfellow? Why do I positively like you, Gregory?' He paused a moment,\\nand then added with a sort of fresh curiosity, 'Is it because you\\nare such an ass?'\\n\\nThere was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out--\\n\\n'Well, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been\\nin in my life, and I am going to act accordingly. Gregory, I gave\\nyou a promise before I came into this place. That promise I would\\nkeep under red-hot pincers. Would you give me, for my own safety, a\\nlittle promise of the same kind? '\\n\\n'A promise?' asked Gregory, wondering.\\n\\n'Yes,' said Syme very seriously, 'a promise. I swore before God\\nthat I would not tell your secret to the police. Will you swear by\\nHumanity, or whatever beastly thing you believe in, that you will\\nnot tell my secret to the anarchists?'\\n\\n'Your secret?' asked the staring Gregory. 'Have you got a secret?'\\n\\n'Yes,' said Syme, 'I have a secret.' Then after a pause, 'Will you\\nswear?'\\n\\nGregory glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said\\nabruptly--\\n\\n'You must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity about\\nyou. Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell\\nme. But look sharp, for they will be here in a couple of minutes.'\\n\\nSyme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into\\nhis long, grey trousers' pockets. Almost as he did so there came\\nfive knocks on the outer grating, proclaiming the arrival of the\\nfirst of the conspirators.\\n\\n'Well,' said Syme slowly, 'I don't know how to tell you the truth\\nmore shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as\\nan aimless poet is not confined to you or your President. We have\\nknown the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard.'\\n\\nGregory tried to spring up straight, but he swayed thrice.\\n\\n'What do you say?' he asked in an inhuman voice.\\n\\n'Yes,' said Syme simply, 'I am a police detective. But I think I\\nhear your friends coming.'\\n\\nFrom the doorway there came a murmur of 'Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.'\\nIt was repeated twice and thrice, and then thirty times, and the\\ncrowd of Joseph Chamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heard\\ntrampling down the corridor.\\n\\n\\n\""
